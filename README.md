# Serene.ai – Student Mental Health Assistant

A full-stack AI-driven web application built for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** to support students’ mental well-being through journaling, counseling, community sharing, meditation, and an empathetic chatbot powered by LLMs.

---

## 🌟 Overview
Serene.ai offers students a safe digital space to:
- Express emotions privately (journals, mood tracking)
- Connect with peers (community posts)
- Seek help (counselor booking)
- Chat empathetically with an AI assistant (Serene)

Built with a modular architecture:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with SQLite (default) or MySQL (for demo)  
- **Chatbot engine:** TinyLlama / Qwen models + FAISS retrieval + ALIVE empathy wrapper

> 🧩 **SIH Hackathon Note:** Firebase integration was originally planned for authentication and data storage.  
> Due to technical limitations at the venue, we used a **MySQL** backend for the live demo while retaining **SQLite** for local development.
